                This structured bootcamp will provide participants with both
                theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience, equipping them
                with the skills needed to excel in their chosen domains.

                <h4 className="text-2xl mt-4 text-center">Registration and Selection Process</h4>
                The bootcamp begins with the registration period for mentors,
                inviting applications from individuals with expertise in the
                relevant domains. Potential mentors will submit their resumes,
                and interviews will be conducted to finalize the selection.
                Once the mentors are finalized, their names will be announced,
                and they will be briefed about their roles and responsibilities,
                ensuring they are well-prepared to guide the participants.
                <br/>
                Next, the registration period for mentees will
                open. Participants will be provided with detailed
                information about the bootcamp structure, the domains
                covered, and what is expected of them. To ensure a
                fair selection process, we will collaborate with
                GeeksforGeeks (GFG) to design and conduct online assessment.
                <br/>
                Based on the assessment scores, the shortlisted participants
                for each domain will be selected and announced. Notifications
                will be sent via email, providing further instructions to the
                selected mentees. The list of finalized mentors will also be
                published on the official website and social media channels.
                <h4 className="text-2xl mt-4 text-center">Bootcamp Schedule</h4>
                The first two weeks of the bootcamp will focus on orientation
                and introductory sessions. Participants will receive an
                overview of each domain and set up the necessary tools and 
                resources. These weeks will include introductory lectures and
                workshops to ensure that all participants are on the same page.
                <br/>
                In weeks three and four, the focus will shift to foundational
                skills development. Participants will engage in hands-on
                tutorials and practical sessions, working on smaller tasks and
                assignments to build their basic knowledge and skills. This
                will lay a strong foundation for the more advanced topics
                and projects to come.
                <br/>
                Weeks five and six will cover advanced topics and intermediate
                projects. In-depth sessions on advanced topics in each domain
                will be conducted, with continued mentorship and guidance from
                the assigned mentors. Participants will begin developing their
                major projects, applying the knowledge they have gained so far.
                The major project development will take place in weeks seven
                and eight. During this period, participants will engage in intensive
                project work, receiving regular feedback and support from their
                mentors. The focus will be on refining and finalizing their projects,
                ensuring they are ready for presentation.
                <br/>
                The final week will be dedicated to presentation and evaluation.
                Participants will present their projects to a panel of mentors
                and industry experts. Evaluations will be conducted, and the bootcamp
                will conclude with a prize distribution and honour roll ceremony,
                recognizing the outstanding efforts of the participants.
